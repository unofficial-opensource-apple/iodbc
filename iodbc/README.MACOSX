Object: how to build iODBC for Mac OS X


Method 1: Using Project builder
================================

You first need to install the Mac OS X Developer Packages from the
December 2001 package, which can be found at:

    http://developer.apple.com/tools


Then, you can open the Project Builder files under mac/iODBC and
mac/iODBCinst, or execute the following commands from a terminal session:

    $ cd mac
    $ make


After building the iODBC frameworks, you have to install them on your
system in /Library/Frameworks with the command: 

    $ cd mac
    $ make install


Now that you have installed the iODBC frameworks on your system, you are
able to use ODBC applications. Just for testing, you can from now build
the odbctest application that you can find under the samples directory :

    $ cd mac/iODBCtest 
    $ pbxbuild


The odbctest command line application can then be found under
mac/iODBCtest/build directory and copied to a directory in your $PATH.
Once you have installed an ODBC driver and configured a DSN, you will
be able to make a connection.



Method 2: Using configure and make
===================================

The iODBC package can also be build like any other OpenSource package not
using any frameworks.

To build the libraries, open up a terminal session and execute the
following commands:

    $ ./configure
    $ make


To install the header files and libraries in /usr/local, you execute
the following command as root:

    # make install
